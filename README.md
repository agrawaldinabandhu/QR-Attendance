This is a MERNSTACK project which focuses on easy and fast attendance system.

Due to this project marking students absent/present has now become a easy task for the teacher.

The teacher just have to add the student in the database and generate the qr code of the student added and voila....The task of the teacher is now complete.
The students themselves will mark their attendance by using the assigned qr code. They will take the photo of the qr code assigned to them and show the code infront of the scanner and the attendance is given.

This helps both the teacher and the students by reducing the time taken to take the attendance of each and every student.

Future Enhancements: -
* Adding doownload and upload feature of the qr code to make the system work more effortlessly.
* Enhancing the security features of this website so the proxy problem would not be a problem anymore.
